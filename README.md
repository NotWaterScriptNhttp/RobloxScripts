this is where i post my roblox scripts

# RobloxJSON.lua
RobloxJSON is more like a configing system for people to use.
Why is it better than roblox's JSON?
because roblox's json formating cannot save Color3's and Key's.
Why should i use it?
because it allows you to save and load configs and even get or set them without running into any issues.
